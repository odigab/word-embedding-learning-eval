The vector field folder contain visualisations of the impact of updating on word embeddings, based on matplotlib and matplot t-SNE (van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008).
In each plot, a single arrow signifies one word, pointing from the position of the original word embedding to the updated representation

- Manual folder: Half of the words were chosen manually to include known word clusters such as days of the week and names of countries; the other half were selected randomly.

- Top100 folder : the top-100 most frequent words

- Random100 folder: 100 randomly-sampled words
